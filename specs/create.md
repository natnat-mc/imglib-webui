# Creation specification
Entity creation can be done in three ways: [upload](uploader.md) (for images), inline (for tags and albums) or normal (for tags and albums).

## Inline creation
The entity is created from a provided name and using sensible default values for the other fields. This is usually done in a [tag/album search](search.md) widget.

## Regular creation
The entity is created with a dedicated page or popup (depending on config, defaults to new page) that allows to set all of its properties, and that can be chained into itself.
